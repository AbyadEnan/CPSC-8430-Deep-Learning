# CPSC-8430-Deep-Learning-HW2

**HW2**

**Before running, the following steps should be followed:**
1. For training: ModelSaveLoc = "TrainedModels" in the main_execution() function in the Main_Exe_V2.py (set as default). Models in this version are executed for 10 epochs.
2. For running the bash script "hw2_seq2seq.sh", in the "main" function, train = False, test=True are provided.
3. For testing, ModelSaveLoc = "Model_final" in the testmodel() function in the Main_Exe_V2.py (set as deafult), and then run the bash script named "hw2_seq2seq.sh" with "testing_data" and result_v2.txt. (During Testing)

**Top 4 models are created in the folders: model1, model2, model3, model4**

**The final model is avaiable in the folder: Model_final**
