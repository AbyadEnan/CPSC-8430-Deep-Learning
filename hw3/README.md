**Top 4 models are created in the folders: model1, model2, model3, model4**

**The final model is avaiable in the folder: Model_final**

**Before running, the following steps should be followed:**
1. For training: ModelSaveLoc = "TrainedModels" in the main_execution() function in the Main_Exe_V2.py (set as default).
2. For running the bash script "hw2_seq2seq.sh", in the "main" function, train = False, test=True are provided.
3. For testing:
   (i) ModelSaveLoc = "Model_final" in the testmodel() function in the Main_Exe_V2.py (set as deafult).
   (ii) Run the bash script named "hw2_seq2seq.sh" with "testing_data" and result_v2.txt (during Testing)
